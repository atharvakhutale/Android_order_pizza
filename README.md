# Android-Order-Pizza
App created with Android Studio. The app was for a personal use and is not affiliated with the actual company. 
The app presents the user with a smaller version for Order Pizzaâ€™s menu. The user can view the menu before ordering and even click on menu items for more information regarding that item. 
The user can order pizza alone, or with an invite number of guests, which will show the user the total at the end of the order and even allow them to tip. 
Items will also be listed on the tip screen. After the tip page, the total, with tip included will be displayed for a single person or split up evenly for orders with a party bigger than one. Individual orders for each guest number, will also be displayed in a scrollable ticket.
